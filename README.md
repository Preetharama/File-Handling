Here's the updated description including the mention of it being beginner-friendly and prepared material

**Java File Handling**

This repository contains methods of file reading and writing in Java. As a self-prepared learning resource, these examples are designed for beginners and can help anyone looking to understand file handling concepts. The repository demonstrates various ways to manage files using classes like `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`, `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`, `FilterReader`, `FilterWriter`, `SequenceInputStream`, `BufferedInputStream`, `BufferedOutputStream`, and `ByteArrayOutputStream`.

**Types of methods**

1)File Reader
2)File Writer
3)File InputStream
4)File OutputStream

**File Reader Examples**

1. **BufferedFRDemo.java**
   Reads from a file using `BufferedReader` for fast character input.
2. **FileRDemo.java**
   Reads a file using `FileReader`.
3. **FilterFRDemo.java**
    Uses `FilterReader` to read from a file with extra processing.

**File Input Stream Examples**

1. **FileISDemo.java**
     Reads from a file byte by byte using `FileInputStream`.
2. **BufferedISDemo.java**
     Reads from a file using `BufferedInputStream` for fast byte input.
3. **FilterISDemo.java**
    Reads a file using `FilterInputStream` for extra processing.
4. **SequenceISDemo.java**
   Combines multiple input streams using `SequenceInputStream` to read from multiple files in sequence.

**File Output Stream Examples**

1. **BufferedOSDemo.java**:
    Writes to a file using `BufferedOutputStream` for fast byte output.
2. **ByteArrayOSDemo.java**
   Writes the same data to multiple files using `ByteArrayOutputStream`.
3. **fileOSDemo.java**
   Writes to a file using `FileOutputStream`.
4. **FilterOSDemo.java**
  Uses `FilterOutputStream` to write to a file with extra processing.

**File Writer Examples**

1. **FileWriterDemo.java**
   Writes text to a file using `FileWriter`.
2. **BufferedFWDemo.java**
  Writes to a file using `BufferedWriter` for fast character output.
3. **FilterFWDemo.java**
  Uses `FilterWriter` to write to a file with extra processing.

These examples provide a clear understanding of various file handling techniques in Java, making them an excellent resource for beginners and anyone looking to enhance their skills.
