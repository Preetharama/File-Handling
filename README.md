# Java File Handling Examples

This repository contains  examples of file reading and writing in Java. As a prepared learning resource, these examples are designed for beginners and can help anyone looking to understand file handling concepts. The repository demonstrates various ways to manage files using classes like `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`, `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`, `FilterReader`, `FilterWriter`, `SequenceInputStream`, `BufferedInputStream`, `BufferedOutputStream`, and `ByteArrayOutputStream`.

# File Reader Examples

1. **BufferedFRDemo.java**: Reads from a file using `BufferedReader` for fast character input.
2. **FileRDemo.java**: Reads a file using `FileReader`.
3. **FilterFRDemo.java**: Uses `FilterReader` to read from a file with extra processing.

# File Input Stream Examples

1. **FileISDemo.java**: Reads from a file byte by byte using `FileInputStream`.
2. **BufferedISDemo.java**: Reads from a file using `BufferedInputStream` for fast byte input.
3. **FilterISDemo.java**: Reads a file using `FilterInputStream` for extra processing.
4. **SequenceISDemo.java**: Combines multiple input streams using `SequenceInputStream` to read from multiple files in sequence.

# File Output Stream Examples

1. **BufferedOSDemo.java**: Writes to a file using `BufferedOutputStream` for fast byte output.
2. **ByteArrayOSDemo.java**: Writes the same data to multiple files using `ByteArrayOutputStream`.
3. **fileOSDemo.java**: Writes to a file using `FileOutputStream`.
4. **FilterOSDemo.java**: Uses `FilterOutputStream` to write to a file with extra processing.

# File Writer Examples

1. **FileWriterDemo.java**: Writes text to a file using `FileWriter`.
2. **BufferedFWDemo.java**: Writes to a file using `BufferedWriter` for fast character output.
3. **FilterFWDemo.java**: Uses `FilterWriter` to write to a file with extra processing.

These examples provide a clear understanding of various file handling techniques in Java, making them an excellent resource for beginners and anyone looking to enhance their skills.
